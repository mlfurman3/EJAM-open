\arguments{
\item{active}{optional. If TRUE, default, returns the registry IDs of sites that seem to be active,
or not obviously inactive, at least, based on closecodes. If FALSE, returns
IDs of sites that are inactive.}

\item{closecodes}{optional, vector of values of ACTIVE_STATUS field assumed
to mean site is inactive}

\item{zfile}{optional Default is national_combined.zip
which contains NATIONAL_ENVIRONMENTAL_INTEREST_FILE.CSV}
