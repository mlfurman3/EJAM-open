EJScreen’s Environmental Justice Analysis Multisite Tool (EJAM) is a
resource provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(US EPA). It lets you easily and quickly see demographic and
environmental information aggregated within and across hundreds or
thousands of places, all at the same time.

### What is EJAM?

- [What is EJAM?](articles/0_whatis.html)

### EJAM as a Web Application

[EJAM can be used as a web app](articles/0_webapp.html), providing a
simple user interface that lets anyone quickly see the results of a
basic analysis.

### EJAM as a Software Toolkit (and Local Web App) for Analysts and Developers

EJAM is also available to analysts and developers as an R Package
written in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/),
with source code on GitHub. When used in RStudio, the EJAM package
provides functions to help analysts work with block group data, points,
and polygons, to very quickly aggregate and compare large numbers of
locations.

Again, installing the R package also allows one to use [EJAM as a local
web app](articles/0_webapp.html) if the shiny app is launched locally on
a user’s own computer.

#### Open-Source Code Policy

Effective August 8, 2016, the <a
href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf"
class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OMB Mandate:
M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency,
and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software</a> applies to
new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the
scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and
Budget’s (OMB’s) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that
all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made
available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in
the <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm"
class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System Life Cycle
Management Procedure</a>. EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version
control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects.
EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and
generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for
broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.
