# Developer note: 
# If you use index.Rmd or README.Rmd it is your responsibility to 
# knit the document to create the corresponding .md. 
# pkgdown does not do this for you because it only touches 
# files in the ⁠doc/⁠ directory.
#
# 1) Edit your README.Rmd file (the .Rmd NOT the .md file)
# 2) Build your README.md file from the README.Rmd file, by clicking Knit in RStudio
#   also check     devtools::build_readme()  ?
#
# 3) Commit both your README.Rmd and README.md
#
# You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render
# `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here:
# <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
#
# Then... 
#    - **See ?pkgdown::build_site** - EJAM now uses the pkgdown R package to build help and vignettes as web pages, and it uses the README.md (not .Rmd) to help build the documentation.

EJScreen's Environmental Justice Analysis Multisite Tool (EJAM) is a resource provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). It lets you easily and quickly see demographic and environmental information aggregated within and across hundreds or thousands of places, all at the same time.

### What Can You Do with EJAM?

-   [What is EJAM?](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/0_whatis.html)

### EJAM as a Web Application

[EJAM can be used as a web app](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/0_webapp.html), providing a simple user interface that lets anyone quickly see the results of a basic analysis.

### EJAM as a Software Toolkit (and Local Web App) for Analysts and Developers

EJAM is also available to analysts and developers as an R Package written in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), with source code on GitHub. When used in RStudio, the EJAM package provides functions to help analysts work with block group data, points, and polygons, to very quickly aggregate and compare large numbers of locations.

Again, installing the R package also allows one to use [EJAM as a local web app](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/articles/0_webapp.html) if the shiny app is launched locally on a user's own computer.

#### Open-Source Code Policy

Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in the [System Life Cycle Management Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [EPA Open Source Project Repo](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and [EPA's Interim Open Source Code Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/developers/open-source-software-and-epa-code-repository-requirements){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

#### Contributing

We encourage analysts and developers to test the EJAM R package and the EJAM shiny app, and provide feedback, or to share code, and we welcome your suggestions or contributions.
