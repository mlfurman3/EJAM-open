#' @details This uses [dataload_from_pins()] and [indexblocks()]
#' 
#' This function `.onAttach()` gets run when the package EJAM is attached, 
#' which happens when library(EJAM) or require(EJAM) is used. 
#' And if [devtools::load_all()] is used, which might mean it loads un-updated local copies or pins copies 
#' rather than the updated source copies in EJAM/data/ but presumably load_all() then replaces those by reading all from /data/ 
#' 
#' This code would not get run if a server ran app.R as a regular shiny app (because of _disable_autoload.R ?)
#' and just used dataload or source to read the /R/*.R source files
#' rather than loading and attaching the EJAM package. see app.R   ***
#' Note this duplicates some code in global.R,
#' see source code here to adjust settings.

  #     Developers may want to modify the .onAttach() or even .onLoad() function,
  #     to control timing of the slow steps needed to load or create EJAM data, 
  #     to have the delays occur at preferred times automatically
  #     (or only manually when a coder initiates them interactively or via their code).
  #     
  #     These occur as EJAM starts:
  #     
  #     1- Download the large datasets stored online (quaddata, blockpoints, frs, etc.) 
  #        EJAM uses dataload_from_pins() for this. Also see dataload_from_local() or dataload_from_aws()
  #        quaddata is >150 MB on disk and >200 MB RAM, while all others are smaller on disk.
  #        blockid2fips is roughly 600 MB in RAM because it stores 8 million block FIPS as text.
  #     
  #     2- Build the national index of all block point locations
  #        EJAM function indexblocks() does this, using quaddata - see ?indexblocks
  #     
  #     3- Load into memory some datasets installed with EJAM (blockgroupstats, usastats, etc.)
  #        EJAM function dataload_from_package() can do this - see ?dataload_from_package and ?datapack()  
  #        Otherwise these are only lazyloaded at the moment they are needed, making a user wait.
  #        blockgroupstats (>60 MB on disk, >200 MB in RAM) and usastats, statestats are essential.
  #        frs-related tables are huge and not always required - needed to look up regulated sites by ID. 
  # 
  #     These are the times at which you may want them to happen:
  #     
  #     - when the EJAM package is loaded and/or attached 
  #       i.e., every time the source package is rebuilt it is loaded; but it is attached less often,
  #       as when a coder uses require( ) in RStudio or script
  #     
  #     - when the shiny app launches and runs the global.R script 
  #        i.e., only once a new user opens the app and their session starts,
  #        and when a coder uses run_app(), either after library( ), or by using EJAM function run_app() 
  #     
  #     - once the app or coder actually needs a given dataset that is available for lazyLoad, which 
  #       works only for data in EJAM/data/ like frs.rda, frs_by_programid.rda, frs_by_sic.rda, etc.
  #       See utils::data( package = 'EJAM' )
  #     
  #     - only if manually obtained by coder via functions noted above.
