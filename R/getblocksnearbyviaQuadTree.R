#' Fast way to find nearby points (distance to each Census block centroid near each site)
#'
#' @description This is what [getblocksnearby()] uses to do the work.
#'   Given a set of points and a specified radius in miles,
#'   this function quickly finds all the US Census blocks near each point.
#'   This does the work actually supporting getblocksnearby()
#'
#' @details
#'   For each point, it uses the specified search radius and finds the distance to
#'   every block within the circle defined by the radius.
#'   Each block is defined by its Census-provided internal point, by latitude and longitude.
#'
#'   Results are the sites2blocks table that would be used by doaggregate(),
#'   with distance in miles as one output column of data.table.
#'   Adjusts distance to avg resident in block when it is very small relative to block size,
#'   the same way EJScreen adjusts distances in creating proximity scores.
#'
#'   Each point can be the location of a regulated facility or other type of site, and
#'   the blocks are a high-resolution source of information about where
#'   residents live.
#'
#'   Finding which blocks have their internal points in a circle provides
#'   a way to quickly estimate what fraction of a block group is
#'   inside the circular buffer more accurately and more quickly than
#'   areal apportionment of block groups would provide.
#'
#' @param sitepoints data.table with columns lat, lon giving point locations of sites or facilities around which are circular buffers
#' @param radius in miles, defining circular buffer around a site point 
#' @param radius_donut_lower_edge radius of lower edge of ring if analyzing ring not full circle
#' @param maxradius miles distance (max distance to check if not even 1 block point is within radius)
#' @param avoidorphans logical If TRUE, then where not even 1 BLOCK internal point is within radius of a SITE,
#'   it keeps looking past radius, up to maxradius, to find nearest 1 BLOCK.
#'   What EJScreen does in that case is report NA, right? So,
#'   does EJAM really need to report stats on residents presumed to be within radius,
#'    if no block centroid is within radius?
#'   Best estimate might be to report indicators from nearest block centroid which is
#'   probably almost always the one your site is sitting inside of,
#'   but ideally would adjust total count to be a fraction of blockwt based on
#'   what is area of circular buffer as fraction of area of block it is apparently inside of.
#'   Setting this to TRUE can produce unexpected results, which will not match EJScreen numbers.
#'
#'   Note that if creating a proximity score, by contrast, you instead want to find nearest 1 SITE if none within radius of this BLOCK.
#' @param quadtree (a pointer to the large quadtree object)
#'    created using indexblocks() which uses the SearchTree package.
#'    Takes about 2-5 seconds to create this each time it is needed.
#'    It can be automatically created when the package is attached via the .onAttach() function
#' @param report_progress_every_n Reports progress to console after every n points,
#'   mostly for testing, but a progress bar feature might be useful unless this is super fast.
#' @param quiet Optional. set to TRUE to avoid message about using getblock_diagnostics(),
#'   which is relevant only if a user saved the output of this function.
#' @param use_unadjusted_distance logical, whether to find points within unadjusted distance
#' @param retain_unadjusted_distance set to FALSE to drop it and save memory/storage. If TRUE, 

#'   the distance_unadjusted column will save the actual distance of site to block internal point
#'   -- the distance column always represents distance to average resident in the block, which is
#'   estimated by adjusting the site to block distance in cases where it is small relative to the
#'   size of the block, to put a lower limit on it, which can result in a large estimate of distance
#'   if the block is very large. See EJScreen documentation.
#' @param updateProgress, optional function to update Shiny progress bar
