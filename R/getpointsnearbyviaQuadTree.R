#' Fast way to find nearby points - For each frompoint, it finds distances to all nearby topoints (within radius)
#' 
#' @description Given a set of frompoints (e.g., facilities or blocks) and a specified radius in miles, 
#'   this function quickly finds all the topoints (e.g., blocks or facilities) near each point.
#'   If from and to are facilities and census blocks, respectively, this can be used to aggregate
#'   over block groups near a facility for an EJAM analysis. But if it is used to define from
#'   as blocks and to as facilities, it finds all facilities near each block, which is how
#'   proxistat works to create proximity indicators.
#'   
#' @details  
#'   The explanation below is assuming frompoints are "sites" such as facilities and
#'   topoints are Census blocks, but they can be reversed as long as the quaddata index
#'   passed is an index of the topoints.
#'   
#'   For each point, this function uses the specified search radius and finds the distance to 
#'   every topoint within the circle defined by the radius. 
#'   Each topoint is defined by its latitude and longitude.
#'   
#'   Results are the sites2points table that would be used by doaggregate(), 
#'   with distance in miles as one output column of data.table. 
#'   
#' @param frompoints data.table with columns lat, lon giving point locations of 
#'   sites or facilities or blocks around which are circular buffers defined by radius.
#'  
#'  - pointid is the indexed topoints id.
#'  
#'  - ejam_uniq_id is the frompoints id
#'  
#' @param radius in miles, defining circular buffer around a frompoint
#' @param maxradius miles distance (max distance to check if not even 1 topoint is within radius)
#' @param min_distance miles minimum distance to use for cases where from and to points are
#'   identical or almost the same location.
#' @param avoidorphans logical If TRUE, then where not even 1 topoint 
#'   is within radius of a frompoint, 
#'   it keeps looking past radius, up to maxradius, to find nearest 1 topoint
#'   
#'   Note that if creating a proximity score, by contrast, you instead want to find nearest 1 SITE if none within radius of this BLOCK.
#' @param quadtree (a pointer to the large quadtree object) 
#'    created using indexpoints() which uses the SearchTree package.
#' @param quaddatatable data.table like quaddata passed to function
#'   - the data.table used to create quadtree, such as blockpoints or frs.
#'    
#' @param report_progress_every_n Reports progress to console after every n points 
#' @param quiet Optional. 
#' @param retain_unadjusted_distance set to FALSE to drop it and save memory/storage. If TRUE, 
#'   the distance_unadjusted column will save the actual distance of site to the topoint, 
#'   which might be zero. adjusted distance uses a lower limit, min_distance 
#' @param updateProgress, optional function to update Shiny progress bar
