#' Very fast way to distances to all nearby Census blocks
#'
#' @description
#'   Get distance from each site (e.g., facility) to each
#'   Census block centroid within some radius
#'
#'   Given a set of points and a specified radius,
#'   this function quickly finds all the US Census blocks near each point.
#'   For each point, it uses the specified radius distance and finds the distance to
#'   every block within the circle defined by the radius.
#'   Each block is defined by its Census-provided internal point, by latitude and longitude.
#'
#'   Each point can be the location of a regulated facility or other type of site, and
#'   the blocks are a high-resolution source of information about where
#'   residents live.
#'
#'   Finding which blocks have their internal points in a circle provides
#'   a way to quickly estimate what fraction of a block group is
#'   inside the circular buffer more accurately and more quickly than
#'   areal apportionment of block groups would provide.
#'
#' @details
#'  See [ejamit()] for examples.
#'
#'  getblocksnearby() is a wrapper redirecting to the right version, like [getblocksnearbyviaQuadTree()]
#'    Census block "internal points" (defined by Census Bureau) are actually what it looks for,
#'    and they are like centroids.
#'    The blocks are pre-indexed for the whole USA, via the data object quadtree aka localtree
