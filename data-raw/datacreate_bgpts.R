#  THE  v2.32 block table from EJScreen team with weights already had PR at least,

length(fips2state_abbrev(rownames(table(substr(bgid2fips$bgfips,1,2)))))
## AS GU MP VI were in blockgroupstats but NOT in bgpts! will drop from blockgroupstats. 
# unique(blockgroupstats[, .(statename, island = is.island(ST), bgcount = .N), by = "ST"])
## ST abbrev is in blockgroupstats and will not be stored in bgpts or bgid2fips etc.

## view those block group points on a map (plot only a subset which is enough)

## view one state, florida, where 12 are the 1st 2 digits of the FIPS:
# bgpts[bgid2fips[substr(bgfips,1,2) == '12', ], on = 'bgid']

## How blockcounts can be done:

## need  data.table pkg loaded

bg_blockcounts2 <- blockwts[ , .(blockcount = .N), by = bgid]
bgpts[ , blockcount := bg_blockcounts2$blockcount]

  # sum(bg_blockcounts2$blockcount == 1)
## [1] 1874 blockgroups have only 1 block
# sum(bg_blockcounts2$blockcount == 1000) # the max is 1000 blocks in a bg
# # [1] 22
  # round(100 * table(bg_blockcounts2[blockcount < 20, blockcount]) / nrow(bg_blockcounts2), 1)
## about 1 to 3 % of all bg contain 10 blocks, 5 blocks, 2 blocks, etc:
##   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19
